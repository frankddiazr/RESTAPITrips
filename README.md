# REST API Using Django, Postgessql and contanized with Docker

Hey everyone!
My name is Frank and I would like to share with you this small proyect created using Django rest Framework (DRF) and contanizaed with Docker, this API will load the data from a csv file sent via HTTP, doing some small transformation with Pandas and store it in Postgres Data base. 


# Deployments
To deploy this API just need to have installed Docker which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), and postman to send the requests to the API, can be downloaded from [here](https://www.postman.com/).
Once installed the applications required, just needed to fork this repository to your local machine and from the folder just downloaded execute the below comands using comand lines tool of your preference :

|           Command                          |Explanation                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|`docker-compose up -d`|Will create the image in docker based on Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml in background mode          |
|`docker-compose exec apitrips python ./jobsity/manage.py makemigrations`          |Will identify what should be migrated            |
